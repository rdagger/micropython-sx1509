"""SX1509 demo (Breathe).
This example demonstrates the SX1509's set-it-and-forget-it
breathe function. The SX1509 will pulse an LED, smoothly
ramping its brightness up-then-down. We'll set the pin up as
an ANALOG_OUTPUT, and call io.breathe() all in setup(), then
watch the LED pulse by itself in loop().

Hardware Hookup:
SX1509 Breakout ---- Pico --------- Breadboard
    GND ------------ GND
    3V3 ------------ 3V3(Out)
    SDA ------------ SDA (GPIO2)
    SCL ------------ SCL (GPIO3)
    15 -----------------------------LED+
                                    LED- --////-- GND
